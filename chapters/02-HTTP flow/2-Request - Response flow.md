## Controller and Routes

A controller is a function (any callable) that returns a response.

A Route is a set of criteria that matches a request:
- matches by host, path, method, â€¦
- has a unique name
- may reference a specific controller

## Symfony Request Object

- To represent the incoming client message, Symfony uses a class from its HttpFoundation component: the Request.
- This object is created when the Runtime component starts  running your Symfony application.
- It contains methods to help you get any information about the Request you might need
- The Request object also contains many ParameterBags, which are sub objects containing the information from the actual HTTP request conveniently formatted and stored in collections.
- By default, an argument typed and named `Request` `$request` given to any controller will contain the current Request object.
