## About validation

- Data validation uses the Validator component
- No configuration is needed after install
- Validation Constraints are applied to the data, and are checked by the Validator
- Constraints are given in the FormTypes or written in your data class
- Constraints can be applied to single datas or at the class level
- Custom constraints can be created

## Validation

With attributes (recommended):

![7.5.1](../assets/07-Forms/5-Data%20validation/7.5.1.png)

With annotations: 

![7.5.2](../assets/07-Forms/5-Data%20validation/7.5.2.png)
