## ORM

The ORM project serves as a link between your data classes and your database storage.

By means of system-agnostic entities, Doctrine will translate your data mapping to the storage and back again.

## Entities

An Entity is the mapping configuration related to a PHP class:
This configuration is available in multiple formats:
- Attributes or annotations (recommended)
- Yaml
- XML
- PHP

With attributes (recommended):

With annotations:

## New entity

You can create a new entity by adding manually some mapping to a PHP class, or you can use the MakerBundleâ€™s `make:entity` command to create both at the same time.

```bash
$ symfony console make:entity Book
```
